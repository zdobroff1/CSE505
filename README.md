## About

This is my final project for CSE 505, using asprilo. The report is the pdf/tex file in the top level.
I added two additional final from the basic asprilo framework: order_management.py and update_adjacent.py.
Both programs implement the basic features meantioned in the writeup.
Additionally, I have updated some other files to allow for easier benchmarking.
